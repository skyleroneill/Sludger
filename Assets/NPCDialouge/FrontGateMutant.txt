Hello, stranger!
Are you a mutant too?
You don't look like any mutant I've ever seen.
No matter. You're still welcome in our sewer mutant village.
Just please don't attack us. We're a peaceful people.
Especially not with your R1 or L1 attacks.
Wait. R1? L1? What does that even mean?
Why'd I say that?
