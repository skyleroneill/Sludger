So what did you think of the NPCs?
Were they funny? Interesting?
You killed everyone... Didn't you? You monster!
Just kidding! They'll come right back if you go back in there.
Not that they really matter anyway.
But lets move on. Next you'll get to meet some less friendly NPCs.
Enemies in this game actually use the same NPC system that the friendly guys use.
You'll get to meet four different enemies.
The signs up ahead will tell you more about each.
Oh, and a pro tip: you're invincible while dashing.
