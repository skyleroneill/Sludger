Did you try out the abilities? Yes? Good.
You probably noticed something strange when you fired bullets.
That's not a glitch but one of this game's main mechanics.
Certain abilites will cost some of Sludger's hp to use
and when Sludger loses health he shrinks.
This means that there is a risk reward to using certain abilities.
You'll lose health at the cost of a useful ability
but you'll also shrink becoming harder to hit.
Don't worry though. There'll be ways to heal.
That's all I have for now. So talk to the next sign.
Seriously, leave me alone.

Fine, keep talking to me and I'll start repeating myself.
I bet that'll annoy you!
