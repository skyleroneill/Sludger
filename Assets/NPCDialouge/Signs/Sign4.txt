The next step on your journey through this prototype will be in this tunnel.
There won't be any of us talking signs for a little bit, but don't be scared!
We'll be back soon enough.
But first you'll get to meet some non-sign NPCs.
Sludger has a robust and modular NPC system.
This means that NPCs can do a lot without having to have fresh code for everything.
Through this tunnel you'll get to see some basic examples of what NPCs can do.
But they are capable of more complex behaviors too.
Or so the guy who made this claims, so I don't know man.
Now go on and meet some mutants in this sewer.
