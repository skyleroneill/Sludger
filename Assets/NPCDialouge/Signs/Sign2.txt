What can Sludger do?
Well, he can walk and interact with things.
But you already know that.
More interestingly, he can use abilities.
Sludger's current abilities are melee attacking [R1], shooting [L1], and dash [B/O].
Don't try them out yet! There's more!
He was designed with an ability slot system.
This means future abilites are both easy to add and can also be swapped out.
That's right you'll be able to create your own playstyle by swapping abilities!
Okay, now you can try those abilites: melee attacking [R1], shooting [L1], and dash [B/O]
